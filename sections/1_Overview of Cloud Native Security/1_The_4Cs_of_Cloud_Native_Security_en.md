# The 4Cs of Cloud Native Security

Cloud native security can be understood through the lens of the "4Cs": Code, Container, Cluster, and Cloud. Each layer builds upon the next, forming a comprehensive security posture.

*   **Code:** Security begins at the application code level. This involves:
    *   Writing secure code, free from common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
    *   Performing thorough input validation.
    *   Managing dependencies securely and scanning them for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regular security testing (SAST, DAST).

*   **Container:** This layer focuses on the security of container images and the containerization process:
    *   Using minimal, trusted base images.
    *   Scanning images for vulnerabilities.
    *   Keeping images up to date with security patches.
    *   Signing images to ensure integrity and provenance.
    *   Applying security contexts to containers to restrict privileges.

*   **Cluster:** Refers to the security of the Kubernetes cluster itself:
    *   Securing control plane components (API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Scheduler).
    *   Proper node configuration and hardening (Kubelet security, OS hardening).
    *   Network segmentation using Network Policies.
    *   Implementing strong authentication and authorization (RBAC).
    *   Managing Secrets securely.
    *   Applying Pod Security Standards.

*   **Cloud (or Co-Location/Corporate Datacenter):** This is the underlying infrastructure where Kubernetes runs:
    *   Secure configuration of cloud provider services (IAM, networking, storage).
    *   Physical security of datacenters.
    *   Compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations for the infrastructure.
    *   Ensuring secure network connectivity to and from the cluster.

Addressing security at each of these four layers is crucial for a robust cloud native security strategy.
