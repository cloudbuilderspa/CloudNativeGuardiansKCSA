# Workload and Application Code Security

Securing workloads and the application code they run involves several key practices:

*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Implementation of secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities in the application code itself. This includes validating inputs, proper error handling, and avoiding common pitfalls like those listed in the OWASP Top 10.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use of Kubernetes Secrets to securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and tokens, rather than hardcoding them into application code or container images.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular scanning of applications, their dependencies, and the workloads themselves to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This should be part of the CI/CD pipeline and ongoing monitoring.
