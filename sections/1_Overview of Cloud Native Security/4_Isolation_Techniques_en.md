# Isolation Techniques in Kubernetes

Effective isolation is a cornerstone of Kubernetes security, helping to limit the blast radius of a potential compromise. Key techniques include:

### Namespaces
Namespaces provide a scope for names and are a primary way to partition cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or applications. They allow you to:
*   Isolate resources: Objects in one namespace are hidden from others by default.
*   Limit scope of permissions: RBAC Roles are namespaced, allowing fine-grained access control within a specific namespace.
*   Apply resource quotas: ResourceQuotas can be defined per namespace to manage resource consumption.

### Network Policies
Network Policies control the traffic flow at the IP address or port level (Layer 3 or Layer 4) between Pods in a cluster. They are crucial for:
*   Segmenting network traffic: Defining which Pods can communicate with each other.
*   Implementing a default-deny posture: Blocking all traffic by default and then explicitly allowing only necessary connections.
*   Limiting lateral movement: Preventing a compromised Pod from easily attacking other Pods or services in the cluster.

### Pod Security Contexts and Pod Security Standards (PSS)
These mechanisms control the security settings and privileges of Pods and their containers:
*   **Security Contexts:** Defined in the Pod or Container spec, they control settings like:
    *   `runAsUser` / `runAsGroup`: Running processes as a specific user/group ID.
    *   `runAsNonRoot`: Preventing containers from running as root.
    *   `readOnlyRootFilesystem`: Making the container's root filesystem immutable.
    *   `allowPrivilegeEscalation`: Preventing a process from gaining more privileges than its parent.
    *   `capabilities`: Dropping unnecessary Linux capabilities.
    *   `seccompProfile`: Applying seccomp filters to restrict syscalls.
*   **Pod Security Standards (PSS) / Pod Security Admission (PSA):** Define cluster-wide security policies (`Privileged`, `Baseline`, `Restricted`) that are enforced at the namespace level by the Pod Security Admission controller. This ensures that Pods adhere to defined security minimums.

By combining these isolation techniques, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your Kubernetes cluster.
