# Main Concepts: The Kubernetes Threat Model

Understanding the Kubernetes threat model is essential for effective system hardening and overall security. Threat modeling is a proactive process of identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors relevant to a system, and then defining countermeasures to prevent or mitigate their impact. This section, based on the KCSA "Kubernetes Threat Model (16%)" domain, explores these concepts.

## Introduction to Kubernetes Threat Modeling

**What is Threat Modeling?**
Threat modeling in the context of Kubernetes involves:
1.  Identifying valuable assets within the cluster (e.g., sensitive data, control plane components, application workloads).
2.  Defining trust boundaries (see below).
3.  Identifying potential threats and attackers (e.g., malicious internal user, external attacker, compromised workload).
4.  Analyzing potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities for each component and data flow.
5.  Prioritizing threats and defining mitigation strategies.

Frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) can be used to categorize threats.

**Why is it Important for Kubernetes?**
Kubernetes is a complex, distributed system with many components and interactions. This complexity creates a large attack surface. Threat modeling helps to:
*   Systematically identify security weaknesses.
*   Prioritize security efforts and investments.
*   Design more secure cluster configurations and application deployments.
*   Improve incident response preparedness.

## Kubernetes Trust Boundaries and Data Flow

Understanding where trust boundaries lie and how data flows is fundamental to identifying potential threats.

### Key Trust Boundaries

A trust boundary is a line where the level of trust changes. Crossing a trust boundary typically requires some form of authentication or authorization.
*   **Control Plane vs. Data Plane:** The control plane (API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Scheduler) is highly trusted. The data plane (worker nodes, Kubelets, Pods) is generally less trusted. Communication from the data plane to the control plane (e.g., Kubelet to API Server) is a critical trust boundary.
*   **Node Isolation:** Each worker node should be isolated from others to prevent a compromise on one node from easily spreading. The Kubelet on a node is a privileged component.
*   **Pod-to-Pod:** By default, Pods on the same cluster network can communicate. Network Policies create trust boundaries between Pods/namespaces.
*   **Container-to-Container (within a Pod):** Containers in the same Pod share network and often other namespaces, representing a very weak trust boundary.
*   **Pod-to-Node (Container Escape):** A critical boundary. If a container process escapes to the underlying node, it can potentially compromise the entire node and other Pods on it.
*   **External World to Cluster:** Any interaction from outside the cluster (e.g., user with `kubectl`, ingress traffic) crosses a major trust boundary.

### Critical Data Flows and Security Implications

*   **User/Client to API Server:** All `kubectl` commands and client library interactions. Must be authenticated and authorized. TLS protects data in transit.
*   **API Server to Etcd:** The API Server is typically the only component that directly talks to `etcd`. This communication must be secured with mTLS (mutual TLS) and strong access controls on `etcd`. `etcd` stores all cluster state, including Secrets.
*   **Kubelet to API Server:** Kubelets watch for Pod assignments and report Node/Pod status. This communication must be secured with TLS and Kubelet client certificates. NodeRestriction and Node Authorizer limit Kubelet permissions.
*   **Controller Manager/Scheduler to API Server:** These components watch and modify cluster state via the API Server. They require appropriate service account permissions (RBAC).
*   **Pod-to-Pod Traffic:** Secured by Network Policies and potentially a service mesh for mTLS.
*   **Pod to External Services:** Egress traffic. Can be controlled by Network Policies.

## Common Threat Categories and Examples in Kubernetes

### Persistence

Attackers aim to maintain access to a compromised system even after reboots or redeployments.
*   **How it Applies to Kubernetes:**
    *   **Backdoored Container Images:** Deploying images with malicious code or reverse shells.
    *   **CronJobs in Compromised Pods/Namespaces:** Scheduling malicious tasks to run periodically.
    *   **Node-Level Persistence:** If an attacker gains root on a node (e.g., via container escape), they can install persistent malware on the node itself (e.g., systemd services, cron jobs).
    *   **Compromised Control Plane Components:** Modifying control plane configurations or binaries if an attacker gains deep access.
    *   **Malicious Admission Controllers or Mutating Webhooks:** Injecting malicious sidecars or modifying Pod specs for persistence.
*   **Mitigations/Considerations:**
    *   Image scanning and signing, use of trusted registries.
    *   RBAC to limit creation of CronJobs.
    *   Node security hardening, runtime security monitoring.
    *   Secure control plane configurations, integrity monitoring.
    *   Secure admission controller webhooks.

### Denial of Service (DoS)

Making resources or services unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **How it Applies to Kubernetes:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Workloads):**
        *   **CPU/Memory:** A Pod consuming all available CPU/memory on a node, affecting other Pods or the Kubelet ("noisy neighbor").
        *   **Network Bandwidth:** Saturating network links.
        *   **PID Exhaustion:** A process creating too many PIDs on a node.
        *   **Disk Space:** Filling up node disk space (logs, ephemeral storage).
    *   **Attacks Against Control Plane Components:**
        *   **API Server:** Overloading with excessive requests (API-level DoS).
        *   **Etcd:** Overwhelming `etcd` with writes or reads, or corrupting its data.
        *   **DNS:** Attacking CoreDNS/kube-dns.
*   **Mitigations/Considerations:**
    *   ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges for namespaces and Pods.
    *   API Server rate limiting.
    *   Secure and resilient `etcd` setup (proper sizing, network isolation).
    *   Network Policies to limit traffic.
    *   Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to handle legitimate load spikes.

### Malicious Code Execution & Compromised Applications in Containers

Running unauthorized code or exploiting vulnerabilities in containerized applications.
*   **How it Applies to Kubernetes:**
    *   **Running Malicious Code in a Container:** An attacker gains execution within an existing container (e.g., through an application vulnerability like RCE) and runs malicious tools or scripts.
    *   **Container Escape Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the container runtime, host kernel, or misconfigurations (e.g., privileged containers) to break out of the container isolation and gain access to the underlying node.
    *   **Lateral Movement from a Compromised Container:** Once a container is compromised, an attacker may try to:
        *   Access other Pods on the same node or network.
        *   Use the Pod's service account token to interact with the API Server.
        *   Exploit vulnerabilities in other cluster services.
*   **Mitigations/Considerations:**
    *   Secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning for application code.
    *   Image scanning, using minimal base images.
    *   Pod Security Standards (PSA) and `SecurityContext` (runAsNonRoot, drop capabilities, readOnlyRootFilesystem).
    *   Seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux profiles.
    *   Network Policies to limit lateral movement.
    *   Regularly update runtimes and host OS.
    *   Runtime security monitoring.

### Attacker on the Network

Exploiting network vulnerabilities to intercept, modify, or disrupt communication.
*   **How it Applies to Kubernetes:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** If TLS is not enforced for communication (e.g., API Server, etcd, Kubelet, between Pods), an attacker on the network could intercept and modify traffic.
    *   **Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic:** Capturing sensitive data if communication is not encrypted.
    *   **Attacks Against CNI or Network Fabric:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CNI plugin or the underlying network infrastructure.
    *   **ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing:** Within the cluster network if not properly segmented or protected.
*   **Mitigations/Considerations:**
    *   Enforce TLS for all control plane communication and Kubelet API.
    *   Use Network Policies to segment traffic.
    *   Consider a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for automatic mTLS between Pods.
    *   Secure the CNI plugin and keep it updated.
    *   Network monitoring and intrusion detection.

### Access to Sensitive Data

Gaining unauthorized access to confidential information.
*   **How it Applies to Kubernetes:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Kubernetes Secrets:** Reading Secrets directly via the API (if RBAC is misconfigured) or from a compromised Pod that has them mounted.
    *   **Accessing Sensitive Data in Volumes:** If Pods have access to PersistentVolumes with sensitive data and are compromised.
    *   **Application Memory:** Sensitive data (credentials, PII) might be present in application memory within a container.
    *   **Information Leakage via Logs or Metadata:** Applications logging sensitive data, or exposed metadata (e.g., via Kubelet read-only port, misconfigured Prometheus endpoints).
    *   **Etcd Data Exposure:** Direct access to `etcd` or its backups if not secured.
*   **Mitigations/Considerations:**
    *   Strong RBAC for Secrets.
    *   Encryption at rest for `etcd` (protects Secrets stored there).
    *   Mount Secrets as files, not environment variables.
    *   Application-level data handling best practices (e.g., not logging sensitive info).
    *   Secure volume mounts, use underlying storage encryption.
    *   Network Policies to restrict access to data services.

### Privilege Escalation

Gaining higher levels of permission than initially authorized.
*   **How it Applies to Kubernetes:**
    *   **Exploiting Misconfigured RBAC:** A user/service account with permission to create/update RoleBindings or certain privileged resources might escalate their privileges. The `passimpersonate` verb is also dangerous.
    *   **Exploiting Overly Permissive Pod Security Settings:**
        *   `privileged: true` containers.
        *   Pods mounting sensitive host paths (`hostPath`).
        *   Pods running as root with excessive capabilities.
    *   **Kernel Exploits from within a Container:** If a container can exploit a kernel vulnerability, it might gain root access on the node.
    *   **Compromising a Privileged Component:** Gaining control of Kubelet, API Server, or `etcd` usually means full cluster compromise.
    *   **Token Theft:** Stealing a more privileged service account token from another Pod or environment.
*   **Mitigations/Considerations:**
    *   Strict RBAC, principle of least privilege.
    *   Enforce strong Pod Security Standards (Baseline/Restricted).
    *   Minimize use of `privileged` mode and sensitive `hostPath` mounts.
    *   Run containers as non-root users, drop unnecessary capabilities.
    *   Keep kernel and all Kubernetes components patched.
    *   Secure Kubelet and control plane components rigorously.

Understanding these threats within the Kubernetes context allows for a more informed approach to system hardening, ensuring defenses are placed at the most critical points.
